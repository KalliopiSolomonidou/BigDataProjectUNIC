The execution order of the .ipynb files is:
Predictive_model_final_project (not necessary as the model is pre-trained and stored in a .plk file )
Streaming_data_final_project (to acquire the last data. *Multiple runs on the same day will create a lot of duplicate data)
Predictions_final_project (to validate the pre-trained model in the freshly acquired data)
